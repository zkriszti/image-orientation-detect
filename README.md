# Detect image orientation & sort images by orientation

A basic, small .js project. It checks the orientation of the provided images by a simple calculation, then displays the value (landscape or portrait) on the image. 

After detection, it also performs a sort: landscape and portrait oriented images are displayed in two separate blocks. It works by cloning the node, but it would be easy to transform it in a way to remove the item from the original collection.
